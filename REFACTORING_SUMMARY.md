# Code Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the improvements made to the codebase to address anti-patterns and implement best practices.

## Issues Fixed

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. Memory Leak Fixed
**Location:** `Game.ts`
**Problem:** Event listener was never removed when scene was destroyed
**Solution:** 
- Added `puzzleStateListener` property to track the listener
- Implemented `shutdown()` method to properly clean up event listeners
- Used `EventBus.off()` to remove listeners on scene destruction

#### 2. Performance Issue - Duplicate Key Creation
**Location:** `Game.ts` 
**Problem:** Creating new key objects every frame in `getMovementInput()`
**Solution:**
- Moved WASD key creation to `setupControls()` 
- Stored keys as class property `wasdKeys`
- Reuse same key objects every frame

#### 3. Separation of Concerns
**Location:** `Player.ts`
**Problem:** Player class was responsible for both movement AND collision detection
**Solution:**
- Split `update()` to only handle movement physics
- Returns intended position for external collision checking
- Added `applyPosition()` method to receive validated position from collision system
- CollisionManager now handles all collision logic

### ðŸŸ¡ Design Improvements

#### 4. Hardcoded Data Extraction
**Problem:** Building layouts hardcoded in scene files
**Solution:**
- Created `src/game/data/BuildingLayouts.ts`
- Moved `MAIN_HOUSE` definition to data file
- Added helper functions (`isWallTile`, `TILE_TYPES`)
- Building collision setup now reads from data file

#### 5. Magic Numbers Eliminated
**Problem:** Unexplained numeric constants throughout codebase
**Solution:**
- Created `src/game/config/GameConstants.ts`
- Centralized all configuration values
- Added descriptive comments for each constant
- Updated all files to import and use constants

#### 6. Error Handling
**Problem:** Non-null assertions (`!`) used without safety checks
**Solution:**
- Added proper keyboard availability check in `setupControls()`
- Added console error logging when keyboard unavailable
- Graceful handling of missing input systems

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor Improvements

#### 7. Type Safety
- Replaced `as any` with proper type definitions
- Added explicit return types to all methods
- Properly typed WASD keys object

#### 8. Code Organization
- Added proper method visibility modifiers
- Consistent return type annotations
- Improved code documentation

## New File Structure

```
src/game/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameConstants.ts          # Centralized configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IslandMaps.ts             # Existing island data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BuildingLayouts.ts        # NEW: Building definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Player.ts                 # Refactored for separation of concerns
â””â”€â”€ scenes/
    â””â”€â”€ Game.ts                   # Fixed memory leaks and performance issues
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: No duplicate key creation, reduced garbage collection
2. **No Memory Leaks**: Proper event listener cleanup
3. **Maintainability**: Constants in one place, easy to adjust
4. **Testability**: Separated concerns make unit testing easier
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new buildings without touching scene code
6. **Type Safety**: Reduced runtime errors with proper TypeScript types

## Configuration

All game constants can now be adjusted in one place:
- Player speed/acceleration: `GameConstants.PLAYER.*`
- Grid dimensions: `GameConstants.GRID_*`
- Camera settings: `GameConstants.CAMERA.*`

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding a `BuildingManager` class to further separate building logic
2. Implement sub-tile collision for more accurate wall boundaries
3. Add unit tests for Player movement logic
4. Consider using a state machine for player states (idle, walking, etc.)
